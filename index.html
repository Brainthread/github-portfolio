            <h2>Beats and Blooms</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A Rhythm-based tower defense game made in Unity3D. Players assume the role of a musician, who has to save the world by planting magical plants, and destroying the darkness that
              threatens to consume all.

            <h2>Trackquiz</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A react application where users log in via their google account, and host music quizes by providing Spotify playlist links. The app looks through the list and generates trivia questions based on the tracks within. 
              Other users can then join the quiz room and participate in the quiz through their own devices, in a realtime multiplayer fashion similar to applications like Kahoot or Mentimeter.

            <h2>AR Ship game</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This game tests the player's multitasking skills like nothing before. Playing as the captain of a ship, the player has to press their arrow keys to steer the ship away from oncoming obstacles. At the same time, they have to direct their crew in order to solve on-board crises, using physical crewmate-tokens on a paper board to do so. <br><br> The system uses Unity as an engine, OBS to read data from a webcamera, and Vuforia to track the tokens caught in those images.
              <br><br>The game was made in 2 weeks for the course DT2140 @ KTH.

          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Hello and welcome to my hub of projects! 

            <br><br> I am Kei. I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science and I am currently studying Interactive Media Technology for my M.Sc. 
            My studies at KTH have encompassed everything from low-level programming and embedded systems, to synthesizing music and shaping physical interaction with digital systems.
            
            <br><br>I have about a decade of experience working with Unity3D, some Blender experience, and have spent an unspeakable amount of hours on designing custom scenarios and mechanics for a vast array of TTRPGs.
            
            <br><br>
            My specific interests are within interaction, graphics, and storytelling. If this is something that interests you as well, hop on over to my contact info so we can get acquainted!
